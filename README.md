# Angular Fullscreen Dialog

## Overview

Dialogs are panels that are overlayed a UI in order to present the user some information or ask for a relatively small action. The panel shouldn't be as involved as the routable views of the applications. Although, on occassion, the design may ask for a fullscreen dialog, essentially having the appearance of a routable view.
